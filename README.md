# Wordle Words
Repo with the two lists of words used by the game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). Both lists are contained in CSV files storing the words in one long column. Used in my Wordle clone, [mywordle](https://circle67.github.io/mywordle).
- `valid-words.csv` is a list of all words that Wordle considers a valid guess (12,972 words)
- `word-bank.csv` is the list of words that Wordle selects the daily word from (2,315 words)

These lists are accurate as of 2/7/22, but probably won't be once NYT officially takes over the game.
## Changes
* Formatted the `.csv` files to be separated by commas rather than new-lines.
